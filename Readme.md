# Overview
__mflow__ facilitates the handling of ZMQ data streams. It provides basic accounting and statistics on messages
received/send as well as an easy way to handle different types of messages within a stream.

Right now mflow comes with following message type support:
* array-1.0
* bsr_m-1.0
* dheader-1.0 (Dectris Eiger)
* dimage-1.0 (Dectris Eiger)
* dseries_end-1.0 (Dectris Eiger)

# Installation
## Pip
The mflow package is available on [https://pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mflow) and can be installed via pip

```bash
pip install mflow
```

## Anaconda

The mflow package is available on [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/paulscherrerinstitute/mflow) and can be installed as follows:

```bash
conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/paulscherrerinstitute mflow
```

# Usage

Connect/Create stream:

```python
stream = mflow.connect(address, conn_type=mflow.CONNECT, mode=mflow.PULL, receive_timeout=None, queue_size=100)
```

Receive a message:

```python
message = stream.receive(self, handler=None)
```

The returned `message` object contains the current receiving  statistics in `message.statistics` and the actual
message data in `message.data`.

If there should be no dynamic resolution of the message handler an explicit handler can be specified to handle the
incoming message.


Disconnecting stream:

```python
stream.disconnect()
```


Sending message (ensure that you specified the correct mode!):

```python
stream.send('message content', send_more=True)
```


Register multiple custom (htype) handlers:

```python
def receive_function(receiver):

      header = receiver.next(as_json=True)
      return_value = {}
      data = []

      # Receiving data
      while receiver.has_more():
          raw_data = receiver.next()
          if raw_data:
              data.append(raw_data)
          else:
              data.append(None)

      return_value['header'] = header
      return_value['data'] = data
      return return_value


my_handlers = dict()
my_handlers['my_htype-1.0'] = receive_function
# ... register more handlers ...

# set handlers
stream.handlers = my_handlers
```

__Note:__ Handlers need to be registered before calling `receive()`.

ÃŸ
Example:

```python
import mflow
stream = mflow.connect('tcp://sf-lc:9999')

# Receive "loop"
message  = stream.receive()
print(message.statistics.messages_received)

stream.disconnect()
```

## Advanced

Manually register more handlers that are not provided by this package (after creating the stream)

```python
stream.handlers['id'] = myhandler
```

# Development

## PyPi
Upload package to pypi.python.org

```bash
python setup.py sdist upload
```

## Anaconda
To build the anaconda package do:

```bash
conda build conda_recipe
```

Afterwards the package can be uploaded to anaconda.org via

```bash
anaconda upload <path_to.tar.bz2_file>
```
